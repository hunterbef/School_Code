Python
    -Interactivity and Portability
        *design goal of portability was accomplished on two ways
            >python compiler translates source code to machine independent byte code, which is run on a python VM
            >application specific libraries support programs that must access databases, networks, the web, GUI, and other resources and technologies
    -Simplicity, regularity, and extensibility
        *asm
    -Dynamic Typing vs Finger Typing
        *python incorporates the dynamic typing mechanism found in lisp and smalltalk
            >all variables are untyped
            >any variable can name any thing, but all things or values have a type
            >type-checking occurs at runtime
        *this results in less overhead for the programmer
            >less "finger typing"
            >programmer can get a code segment up and running much faster
