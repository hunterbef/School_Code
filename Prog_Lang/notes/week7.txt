Basic Elements of Java
    -
    -Class method
        *static method  (unmoving location in memory)
        *JVM runs the program as:
            >TextComplex.main(<array of strings>)
                -commmand line arguments present at launch are placed into the args array
        *all classes inherit from the Object class by default
        *data encapsulation is enforced by declaring instance variables with private access
            >they are visible only within the class definition
        *accessor methods
            >allow programs to view but not modify the internal state of a class
    -Constructors
        *like methods they specify initial values for instance variables and perform other
    
    - == is the equality operator for primitive types and also means object identity for reference types

    -Dynamic Binding and Static Binding
        *static Binding 
            >process of determining at compile time which implementation of a method to use by determining the objects actual class
                -actual code is not generated by the compiler unless the method is declared as final or static
