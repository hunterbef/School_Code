------------
Truth about Programming Languages
    -thousands exist
    -popular does not mean popular forver
    -more created every year
Machine Readability
    -no ambiguity
    -efficient translation/compilation
    -covered in CSE4305 : Compilers
Human Readability
    -more important than machine readability
        *abstactions for describing the actions
        *control abstraction: transfer of control in computation
    -human to human communications
        *your program will be read by others

Paradigms
    -Imperative/Procedural
        *ALGOL, FORTRAN, Pascal, C, Ada
        *control statements, manipulate the data and program states
    -Object Oriented
        *C++, Java, Smalltalk
        *data/object-centric
    -Functional
        *Lisp, Scheme, ML, Haskell
        *everything is done by function evaluations
    -Logic

    -Parallel

    -Mix

Syntax and Semantics
    -Syntax
        *form/looks
        *structure of programs (tokens, keywords, statements)
    -Semantics
        *the expected behavior of a given syntactical construct
    -can a language exist without syntax?


Chapter 1:
-----------------
Origins of Programming Languages
    -Programming language
        *a notation for communicating
Assumptions about programming
    -how much does code weigh?
        * ~5lbs
Machine Language and the first stored programs
    -John von Neumann
        *proposed that computers should be permanently hardwired with a small set of general purpose operations
            >would allow operator to input series of binary codes to organize basic hardware
