    /*
    #include goes and finds files and libraries
        <> finds the library within the C system files
        "" finds the files within the working directory
    #define creates symbolic constants - similar to final constants in java

    lvalue and rvalue
        lvalue - expression that has a location in memory; left side
        rvalue - same thing but right side
            x                   both left and right value, eg x = x; is valid
            x + 3               not left side but right side, eg x = x + 3 is valid but x + 3 = x; is not
            2 * x - 7
